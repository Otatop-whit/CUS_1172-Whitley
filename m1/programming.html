    <h1> Programming Experience </h1>
    <p>
        As for my overall programming experience, I am fairly confident in my Java programming skills. 
    </p>
    <p> Currently, I am in the process of furthering my knowledge in other programming languages. Hoping to learn html, CSS, and Javascript by the end of the semester. By the end of my senior semester I should have more confidence in my programming abilities besides Java. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Some other languages I have used before:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> C </li>
        <li> MySQL</li>
        <li> Python </li>
        <li> Lua </li>
    </ul>

            <h1> My General Interests </h1>
            <p>
                Aside from programming and computer science, I have a few other interests that I enjoy spending my time on.

            <h3> Interest in the Arts </h3>

               <h4> Practicing the Art</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my main interests is drawing. 
                    I like to draw my own characters with a potential goal to one day make a comic in the future. 
                    I have also done a little bit of animation as I took a course in High School. 
                    It really helped getting a flow of imagining characters in movement.

            <h4> Consuming the Art</h4>
            <p>
                Continuing the topic of art, I also enjoy reading manga and watch anime. 
                Some manga I have read were Tokyo Ghoul, Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, and Vagabond. 
                Almost every one of these have had an anime adaptation to which I have also watched.
                Manga and anime has been a huge inspiration in my art style and creativity.

            <p>
                Aside from reading manga and watching anime, I enjoy listening to music. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres, including jazz, pop, classical, electronic music, and more. 
                I love how music has the power to evoke emotions and create a sense of atmosphere, which is great for coming up with cool art ideas/ composition. 
                I really enjoy listening to scores from video games or tv shows as they really set the tone for a scene and vibe that the audience should be having.

            <p>
                Some additional activities is playing video games. I enjoy playing roguelikes, rpgs, mmos, and strategy games. 
                Sometimes I really forget that I have played a lot of games over the years.
